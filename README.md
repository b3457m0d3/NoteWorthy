==============================================================================

####A Center Mast for Creative Endeavors 

######*Still very much a work in progress*
Built from the ground up for use with the **Galaxy Note** series 

###Credit Where Credit's Due
-Utilizes Alan Tai's **awesome** wrapper lib for the Spen
-Also built with **Sprinkles** for MVC & straightforward db access
-Bundled with **JQuery** (*UI* & *mobile*) *and* **Font-awesome**
-And themed to look like a native app with **Native Droid** *a JQuery UI theme*
-Incorporates the **JCoverFlow** plugin


###Custom Helper classes for: 
-Working directly with the Application object (*global access*)
-Creating, maintaining, and interacting with SpenNoteDocs 
-Keeping data persistent between the database & each SpenNoteDoc file  
-Easing WebKit development with a basic JS Interface linking to native functions
-Loading and applying custom fonts from your assets folder
-Structuring database tables in SQL
